 <p className='paratext'> <h1>TRANSPORT</h1> We pay close attention to the travel safety of our students. With a fleet of buses with 40 seats each, we ensure every student gets <br/>comfortable seating during their journey. Our buses meet all the required government regulation standards and have well-trained <br/>drivers who take care of pick-ups and drops on the assigned routes. We also have bus attenders who look after the students <br/>and take care of seating arrangements.</p>

The in-house library also subscribes to leading national dailies and journals. We also have an audio and video collection that can be used to augment classroom learning</p>

<div id='S' ><p className='paratext'><h1>SPORTS</h1>All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. At all our institutions, we encourage a healthy balance of work and play. Students are encouraged to experience the challenge and reward of sports through diverse programmes at the school level.

Our sports department is managed by qualified and competent instructors who design a sports curriculum that improves mental strength, concentration, physical conditioning and coordination, strategic and tactical planning and of course, teamwork.

We conduct an annual inter-branch sports meet, along with a variety of other activities like athletics, team games, and indoor games.
