    <h4><b>CURRICULUM</b></h4><img src="https://srichaitanyaapp.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/prod/assets/uploads/0/63c94b7406-curriculum-icon.png"/>
    <p>Sri Chaitanya devised a strong Curriculum, integrating the components of Maths, Physics, Chemistry and Biology which are needed for the various Entrance Exams under the name of TECHNO CURRICULUM.

        The Content Matter is divided into optimum doses so that the students do not feel overburdened with the syllabus. At the same time care is taken to see that the Components of the Techno Curriculum are strictly according to their Normal Course of Study related to the Class in which they are studying at present.
        
        This makes them study their present syllabus in depth with the help of the Micro Level Teaching, providing them the chance of improving their performance in the current Class in which they are studying.</p>
        
        <strong>C- BATCH:</strong><p>Our C-Olympiad batch is a platform where the students with a strong academics potential and inclination are trained on customized preparatory material to take on the tough National and International Olympiads and step into the portals of prestigious National level professional institutions-IIT’s, NIT’s etc.
